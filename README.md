###Front-end Requirements
You must have a UI of some kind! But you can build using any number of technologies:

* React, React Native, ReactVR
* Electron (HTML/CSS/JavaScript apps for the desktop)
* Amazon Echo
* Kinect (or some other physical gesture recognizer)
* If you are building a UI for the browser:

It must be responsive, with at least 3 different breakpoints
Axios or fetch is recommended for Ajax.
### Backend Requirements
* You are free to build a backend in any technology you choose! Node is the most obvious choice, but you are welcome to build using Python, Ruby, Java, C#/.NET, Go, Elixir, etc.
* I strongly recommend not using a Backend-as-a-Service such as Firebase. If you feel like you have a compelling reason to use Firebase, let's discuss.
* You must have a database. Postgres is recommended, but you are free to use MySQL, Mongo, Neo4j, Cassandra, or other ones.
* Yes! Do put SSL on your server!
